## Lab Summaries

### Lab 2 - Array Implementation and Manipulation
Explored array creation, constructors, access methods, arithmetic operations, error handling, and matrix textual representation.

### Lab 3 - Unit Testing and Code Verification
Focused on testing individual class methods, managing errors, and ensuring expected outcomes during code verification.

### Lab 4 - Structured Document Generation and JSON Handling
Developed classes for generating HTML-formatted documents like CVs, tested functionalities, and practiced data serialization/deserialization with Gson.

### Lab 5 - Mathematical Expressions as Graphs
Introduced graph representation of mathematical expressions, teaching expression building, value calculation, printing, and symbolic derivative computation.

### Labs 6-9 - Advanced Java Programming Techniques
Covered advanced Java programming techniques in a project on Poland's administrative units, including data filtering, predicates, lambdas, inner classes, comparator functions, and streams. Implemented bounding boxes for identifying neighboring units and utilized various data structures, such as hash maps.

### Lab 10 - Vector Graphics Creation with Swing
Learned to create vector graphics using Swing, including drawing a Christmas tree, and applied graphic programming with JPanel, Graphics, Graphics2D, and affine transformations.

### Lab 11 - Threads and User Interface Graphics
Created a thread-based clock displaying time on the console and UI, implemented an analog clock with dynamic hand updates using affine transformations, and managed concurrent file downloads with a custom Downloader class.

### Lab 12 - Parallel Data Processing with Threads
Utilized threads for parallel data processing and asynchronous computations, calculating averages from large datasets with synchronization methods like join(), BlockingQueue, and ExecutorService with CompletableFuture.

### Lab 14 - Game Development with Java and Swing
Programmed a game where animated characters (zombies) move across the screen, with user interaction through mouse clicks for elimination, mirroring a task from an Introduction to Web Applications lab, differing in language and platform: Java and Swing.
